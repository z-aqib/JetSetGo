# dataset
since the dataset was too huge to upload on git (around 3 million rows) the raw data was 615MB and the cleaned one was 690MB    
thus we have extracted the first ~1K rows and uploaded that as a sample, the actual whole dataset is uploaded on kaggle PUBLIC so anyone can use it freely!    
here's the link, you may use the data cleaning notebooks to your choice :)
